## Description :apple:

BestPrice is a web application which compares store prices to not only find the best deals, but also the best overall price you have to pay. 

## Inspiration :sparkles:
<p> People tend to find good deals by comparing the prices of individual items at different stores. However, a store having one item significantly cheaper than the other store does not necessarily imply that the total grocery cost (of all items) will be cheaper at that store. </p>
<p> Therefore, we built a web application which finds the cheapest price of your ENTIRE grocery list, instead of showing you the best deal of individual items. Through this, a user can always be sure that they are getting their groceries for the cheapest total price.


## Running Instructions :computer:
Install the dependencies in frontend and server first by executing the following commands
```bash
cd front_end/best_price && npm install
cd back_end && npm install
```
Then, go to the root directory (Best Price), and in command line execute: 
```
make front
```
In another terminal in the same directory, execute:
```
make back
```
The latter wil get the backend running, and since front end is already up and running, open the front end, and save some money on grocery! :moneybag:

#### NOTE: Run the server before running the web app: See makefile for the respective commands 

## Accomplishments we're proud of :100:
This was our first time building plenty of things. It was our first time building a fully functional React application (Running Python Scripts from a Node Server was quite challenging). We also learned (and loved!) to use an agile methodology to develop the project in an organized manner. Video, graphic design, and editing (Merging the different clips + background music + audio) was also a very fun challenge which we are very proud to complete!
  
## What is next for Best Price :thought_balloon:
We want to explore a huge playground of various ideas with Best Price. We have aready started working on integrating the Vision API, which will fill in the grocery items by looking at a picture of a user's handwritten list. Further, we want to add many more stores, to ensure that a user gets the best price amongst all stores in the area.
We would also love to explore adding delivery service to Best Price, in which a user will get the items from the store deemed with the best price at their door. We are looking forward to making it a mobile app for better convenience too!
